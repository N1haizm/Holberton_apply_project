        <p>Who is this Nihad Åžirinli? Good question.</p>
        <h2>The best, overly confident candidate that applies to Holberton School. ðŸ˜†</h2>
        <p>Just kidding. ButðŸ¤” Actually he is ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£</p>
        <h3>What is his purpose and why does he apply to Holberton School?</h3>
        <p>His Ultimate purpose is becoming the best <span class="red">Red Teamer/Penetration Tester</span> in the world. So, you can ask:<br> Why would a penetration tester apply to a development course?<br> If you ask this question this means you don't know what is under the iceberq "CYBERSECURITY". <br>In order to pentest a system, you <b>HAVE TO KNOW</b>  the system that you are looking for vulnerabilities. <br>So, Nihad actually seperates his purposes into 2 parts: <br> 1.Long Term <br>2.Short Term <br>As Long term he made purpose <b>Cybersecurity</b>, <br> As Short term he made <b>Networking, Web Development, System Administration</b>  etc. in just one word the other fields of IT. <br>He plans to deepen his knowledge in Programming. He may even start malware development as a penetration tester. <br>of course ethically.</p>
        <h1>Let's take a look at his short life story in IT field</h1>
        <p>You have to read this part because this is not even written in CV <br> Once upon a time, there was ðŸ˜‚ðŸ¤£ Just Kidding, this is gonna take short. <br>He started his career in IT since he qualified to University in 2021. First he started by learning C# OOP, he learned OOP principles very well. <br>After that he learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript well but first times he had hard times with React.js. <br>AHAAHAHAHA loser then he couldn't learn React very wellðŸ¤£. But if he tries to learn it right now he would crush itðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆðŸ˜ˆ. <br>I gave you a secret about what i feel about web development in <a href="http://15.237.115.208/about.html">About</a> page. <br> After that he started learning and learned Backend development with Node.js thanks to <a href="https://www.udemy.com/user/maximilian-schwarzmuller/" target="_blank">Maximilian SchwarzmÃ¼ller</a>. <br>he then learned how to write RestAPIs and learned how RestAPIs work. <br>After that when he was about to learn GraphQL he was qualified to Azerbaijan Cybersecurity Center. <br>And this is the point he got into Cybersecurity. You may know there because Holberton School is in 26th floor of Chinar Plaza and they are in 27th floor. <br>You may know me, i came to your classes because there are a lot of people that i know and they know me because i am very Famous ASDFASDFASDFðŸ˜ˆ. <br>So, Right now He learns Networking from Cisco Networking Academy and if Nihad will qualify to Holberton he can continue to learn both programming and networking. <br>He is capable of anything he sets his mind toðŸ˜Ž</p>
